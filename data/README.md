# Data Artifacts

## Problem Statement
Simulating real-world attacks for testing a WAF without generating dangerous live traffic is difficult. Developers need a safe, representative dataset to verify model performance offline.

## Solution Overview
This directory stores static **CSV datasets** used for:
1.  **Validation**: Testing the model accuracy.
2.  **Simulation**: Providing "fake" live traffic for the Frontend dashboard.
3.  **Logging**: Storing user feedback for future retraining.

## ML Models Used
Models **consume** this data, but the data itself is model-agnostic.

## Dataset Used
### `test_samples_final.csv`
A curated subset of 42+ samples from CIC-IDS-2017/2018.
- **Columns**: 40+ numeric features + Label.
- **Purpose**: Used by the Streamlit App to simulate "Incoming Requests".

### `feedback_log.csv`
A log file generated by the application.
- **Content**: Timestamp, Request ID, Model Decision, User Feedback (Correct/Incorrect).
- **Purpose**: Ground truth for Active Learning.

## How to Run the Project
These files are automatically read by `UI/waf_gui.py`. No manual execution required.

## Innovation / Future Scope
*   **Feedback Loop**: The existence of `feedback_log.csv` enables a "Human-in-the-loop" ML pipeline.
*   **Database Integration**: Future scope involves transitioning from CSV to PostgreSQL/SQLite for scale.
